# A learning programme with a database of questions and answers


**HOW IT WORKS?**

We need to have a txt file in which the odd lines contain the questions and the even lines contain the answers. Both the question and the answer must fit on one line, which is made possible by Notepad, which can fit many words on one line without moving to the next line. 

When a question appears, pressing any button shows the answer
